# FEND Project 2: Match Game
This matching game is developed to meet basic criteria of the Udacity course project. The goal is to match pairs of cards to reveal all the cards face up, which is achieved by “flipping” the card and finding two cards with the same symbol. 

## Card Flipping
Cards can be flipped by clicking on them. It is not possible to open more than two cards at a time. When two cards are open and are matched, they will stay faced up. If the two cards are not a match, they will flip back over. 

## Time, Moves, and Stars
The game will keep track of how long it takes you to complete every match and will provide you a star rating, associated with the number of moves you made. 


..* 3 Stars: less than 32 moves
..* 2 Stars: less than 48 moves
..* 1 star: 48+ moves

## Winning
When all Pairs are found, a summary of your achievement will appear stating your time, moves, and stars.
